Typesetter
=================

Stable releases available for use at http://www.typesetter.symbolset.com/

The Font Testing Page is a tool primarily intended for type designers and independent foundries to 'Drag and Drop' their work in progress into a browser. It can also be used by art directors, graphic designers, teachers and students interested in seeing how a typeface works on the web.

There is a short video demonstrating this tool, http://vimeo.com/40296571

Operation is simple:

- First, you must accept the request from the browser.
- Then drag the font you want to try to the upper area of the Testing Page
- Add more fonts and you'll see their file names and file sizes as buttons

Below the drop area you see some buttons to select different layouts:

Notes:

- Requires Firefox 3.6+/Chrome 13+
- 100% Javascript
- 100% safe: Your fonts are only stored in your own browser (using `localStorage`) and **nothing gets uploaded to any server**
